              Xi'an (Chinese: 西安; pinyin: Xī'ān; ), sometimes romanized as
              Sian, is the capital of Shaanxi Province. A sub-provincial city on
              the Guanzhong Plain in Northwest China, it is one of the oldest
              cities in China, the oldest prefecture capital and one of the
              Chinese Four Great Ancient Capitals, having held the position
              under several of the most important dynasties in Chinese
              history,including Western Zhou, Qin, Western Han, Sui, Northern
              Zhou and Tang. The city is the starting point of the Silk Road and
              home to the UNESCO World Heritage set Terracotta Army of Emperor
              Qin Shi Huang.Since the 1980s, as part of the economic growth of
              inland China especially for the central and northwest regions,
              Xian has re-emerged as a cultural, industrial, political and
              educational centre of the entire central-northwest region, with
              many facilities for research and development, national security
              and space exploration. Xian currently holds sub-provincial status,
              administering 11 districts and 2 counties. The city is the third
              most populous city in Western China, the other two being Chongqing
              and Chengdu, as well as the most populous city in Northwestern
              China.

              Shenzhen (Chinese: 深圳; pinyin: Shēnzhèn;), also known as Sham
              Chun, is a major sub-provincial city and one of the special
              economic zones of China. The city is located on the east bank of
              the Pearl River estuary on the central coast of southern province
              of Guangdong, bordering Hong Kong to the south, Dongguan to the
              north, and Huizhou to the northeast. With a population of 17.56
              million as of 2020, Shenzhen is the sixth most populous city
              proper in China. Shenzhen is a global center in technology,
              research, manufacturing, finance, and transportation, and the Port
              of Shenzhen is the world's fourth busiest container port.Shenzhen
              roughly follows the administrative boundaries of Bao'an County,
              which was established since imperial times. The southern portion
              of Bao'an County was seized by the British after the Opium Wars
              and became Hong Kong, while the village of Shenzhen was situated
              on the border. Due to the completion of a train station that was
              the last stop on the Mainland Chinese section of the railway
              between Guangzhou and Kowloon, Shenzhen's economy grew and became
              a market town and later a city by 1979, absorbing Bao'an County
              for the next decade.

              Hong Kong (Chinese: 香港), officially the Hong Kong Special
              Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China
              (HKSAR),[d] is a city and special administrative region of China
              on the eastern Pearl River Delta in South China. With over 7.5
              million residents of various nationalities in a
              1104-square-kilometre (426 sq mi) territory, Hong Kong is one of
              the most densely populated places in the world. Hong Kong is also
              one of the most developed cities in the world.Hong Kong was
              established as a colony of the British Empire after the Qing
              Empire ceded Hong Kong Island from Xin'an County at the end of the
              First Opium War in 1841 then again in 1842. The colony expanded to
              the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 after the Second Opium War and was
              further extended when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the New
              Territories in 1898. British Hong Kong was occupied by Imperial
              Japan from 1941 to 1945 during World War II; British
              administration resumed after the surrender of Japan.The whole
              territory was transferred to China in 1997. As one of China's two
              special administrative regions (the other being Macau), Hong Kong
              maintains separate governing and economic systems from that of
              mainland China under the principle of "one country, two
              systems"<strong

              Shanghai (Chinese: 上海),is one of the four direct-administered
              municipalities of the People's Republic of China. The city is
              located on the southern estuary of the Yangtze River, with the
              Huangpu River flowing through it. With a population of 24.87
              million as of 2020, it is the most populous urban area in China,
              the most populous city proper in the world and the only city in
              East Asia with a GDP greater than its corresponding capital.
              Shanghai is a global center for finance, business and economics,
              research, education, science and technology, manufacturing,
              tourism, culture and transportation, and the Port of Shanghai is
              the world's busiest container port.Originally a fishing village
              and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century
              due to both domestic and foreign trade and its favorable port
              location. The city was one of five treaty ports forced to open to
              European trade after the First Opium War. The Shanghai
              International Settlement and the French Concession were
              subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a
              primary commercial and financial hub of Asia in the 1930s. During
              the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the major
              Battle of Shanghai. After the war, with the communists takeover of
              the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist
              countries and the city's global influence declined.<strong
